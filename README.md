# ecowitt_mqtt_bridge
A MQTT Bridge to Home Assistant for Ecowitt Gateways

History: For me the "Ecowitt Local" and other integrations were not working as expected or desired.
So here's another approach: Since newer firmwares for the Ecowitt gateways support uploading information via MQTT it's an easy way to get your entities into Home Assistant. The cool thing is: Whenever ecowitt changes their available data you can easily add the necessary key by yourself!
